I want you to REALLY carefully analyze their plans with an open mind and be intellectually honest about what they did that's better than your plan. Then I want you to come up with the best possible revisions to your plan (you should simply update your existing document for your original plan with the revisions) that artfully and skillfully blends the "best of all worlds" to create a true, ultimate, superior hybrid version of the plan that best achieves our stated goals and will work the best in real-world practice to solve the problems we are facing and our overarching goals while ensuring the extreme success of the enterprise as best as possible; you should provide me with a complete series of git-diff style changes to your original plan to turn it into the new, enhanced, much longer and detailed plan that integrates the best of all the plans with every good idea included (you don't need to mention which ideas came from which models in the final revised enhanced plan): |
| complete_docusaurus_site               | Now I need you to look through the existing documentation in our docusaurus site here and look for the (many, many) instances of functionality in our project that are not described or explained at all yet (or explained inadequately) in the docusaurus site, and then create and expand the documentation in the site to cover these in an exhaustive, intuitive, helpful, useful, pragmatic way. Don't just make a dump of methods, parameters, etc. Add actually well-written narrative explaining what the stuff does, how it is organized, etc. to help another developer understand how it all works so that they can usefully contribute to the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| create_tests                           | Do we have full unit test coverage without using mocks/fake stuff? What about complete e2e integration test scripts with great, detailed logging? If not, then create a comprehensive and granular set of beads for all this with tasks, subtasks, and dependency structure overlaid with detailed comments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

If so, revise the beads. It's a lot easier and faster to operate in "plan space" before we start implementing these things!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| leverage_tanstack_libraries            | Ok I want you to look through the ENTIRE project and look for areas where, if we leveraged one of the many TanStack libraries (e.g., query, table, forms, etc), we could make part of the code much better, simpler, more performant, more maintainable, elegant, shorter, more reliable, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| scrutinize_and_improve_workflow_and_ui | Great, now I want you to super carefully scrutinize every aspect of the application workflow and implementation and look for things that just seem sub-optimal or even wrong/mistaken to you, things that could very obviously be improved from a user-friendliness and intuitiveness standpoint, places where our UI/UX could be improved and polished to be slicker, more visually appealing, and more premium feeling and just ultra high quality, like Stripe-level apps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| start_out_with_agent_mail              | Be sure to check your agent mail and to promptly respond if needed to any messages; then proceed meticulously with your next assigned beads, working on the tasks systematically and meticulously and tracking your progress via beads and agent mail messages. Don't get stuck in "communication purgatory" where nothing is getting done; be proactive about starting tasks that need to be done, but inform your fellow agents via messages when you do so and mark beads appropriately. When you're really not sure what to do, pick the next bead that you can usefully work on and get started. Make sure to acknowledge all communication requests from other agents and that you are aware of all active agents and their names.
